# Welcome to LLAMAFY

Have you ever looked in your wardrobe and decided you have nothing to wear? Have you warn the same outfit two weeks in a row?

Well worry no more!

Introducting LLAMAFY!

## What we are

LLAMAFY aims to make your life at least 10x easier by allowing you to forgo making one more decision a day. Based on the items that you already have in your wardrobe, we will generate three potential outfits for you to choose from at a time and make your life that much simpler. 

## How to use

You can use LLAMAFY with these simple steps:

1. Register with LLAMAFY and submit some of the basics that you have in your wardrobe
2. Go to your wardrobe and generate your outfit for the day
3. That's it!

From here you can select the outfits that you like and the ones you don't. You can keep an eye on past outfits that you have warn and you can simplify your morning (or afternoon, we don't judge) decision making process by not having to choose what to wear.

Disclaimer section:

We have decided that since New Zealand has been left off the map far too often it is time to leave everywhere else off the map to give the rest of the world a taste of their own medicine. This is subject to change based on the frequency that we begin to appear on maps in future as the functionality is there but the will is not.
